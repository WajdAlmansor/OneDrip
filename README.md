# OneDrip ðŸŒ±

**OneDrip** is a habit-building iOS app that helps users grow their skills through consistent, minimal daily effort. The concept is inspired by the idea of small progress â€” one drop at a time â€” leading to meaningful, lasting change.

## ðŸ§  Concept

OneDrip encourages users to commit to a single goal and maintain a short daily routine. The experience is designed to be calming, focused, and motivating â€” using visuals, streaks, and gentle reminders to stay on track.

## ðŸ”¨ Current Development

This project is currently **in development**. Several key components have already been implemented and are included in the codebase:

- âœ… Full SwiftUI frontend with custom design elements and layout
- âœ… Journey setup screen that collects user input (goal, duration, daily time, start time)
- âœ… Apple Sign-In integration using `AuthenticationServices`
- âœ… CloudKit integration for:
  - Creating and saving user records
  - Saving and retrieving "Journey" entries in the public iCloud database
- âœ… Timeline-style scroll for daily reflections with support for notes, media, and voice input
- âœ… Carousel for navigating between multiple journeys
- âœ… Settings page with UI structure for account, notification, and privacy controls

All data is stored securely in **Appleâ€™s CloudKit**, not Firebase. The app avoids third-party backend services and relies entirely on the Apple ecosystem.
